A project to determine the *exact* algorithm used to solve simple 
algebra-based physics problems. Framework potentially useful as a homework 
'helper' app, or as a 'partial credit' grading app. 

But mostly just so I can teach better. By forcing a computer to solve the 
problems, I expose every little assumption we have to make.

To Do:

- Lots of stuff :)
